# Virtual_mouse
Virtual mouse using Python and computer vision

This project implements a virtual mouse using Python and computer vision techniques. The virtual mouse allows users to control the cursor on their computer screen without using a physical mouse. The system detects and tracks hand movements in real-time through a webcam, translating gestures into mouse actions such as moving the cursor, clicking, and scrolling.
